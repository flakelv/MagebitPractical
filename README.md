# MagebitPractical

Hello,
I've done as much as I could with the given time.
Before I get into the technical stuff, I'd just like to say that I haven't finished entirely, and my stopping stone unfortunately started at task 3. I was unable to figure out how to send form data (email) without redirecting to the php file itself as well as displaying the "Thank you..." screen. I honestly spent a lot of time trying to figure this one out, but nothing I tried seemed to work, and I wanted to keep it as neat as possible, so I figured I won't make it redirect to a site that's just blank and I'll make it stay at the "Thank you screen..." although in my project I have included the "connection.php" which initially is the file that I connected to the database with. In case you want to try the php mysql connect to database, you're going to need XAMPP Control panel, put the 'Magebit' folder inside (xampp/htdocs) and within XAMPP, you will need to host an Apache and MySQL servers. After that you can simply type in any browser : localhost/Magebit/index.php and you should be set. (For this I also had a database named "data" with a table named "data" in phpMyAdmin.)
That being said, I'm fairly new to php, as I am currently in my midsemester for a PHP course in my University, and my pure lack of experience is probably why I was unable to figure out a wayto send a form and not redirect to php while also showing the "Thank you..." screen. 
Running this project through PHPStorm is much easier, as you simply just have to open the project folder in your IDE and then you can run it straight from there (either preview or one of the browsers). 
This project was built using PHPStorm and took me around 5 days of on and off coding.
